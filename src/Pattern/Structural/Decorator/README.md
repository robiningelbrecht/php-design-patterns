# Decorator

__Decorator__ is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects 
by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.

__Identification__: Decorator can be recognized by creation methods or 
constructor that accept objects of the same class or interface as a current class.
