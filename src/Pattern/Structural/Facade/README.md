# Facade

__Facade__ is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, 
or any other complex set of classes.

__Identification__: Facade can be recognized in a class that has a simple interface, 
but delegates most of the work to other classes. Usually, facades manage the full life cycle of objects they use.
