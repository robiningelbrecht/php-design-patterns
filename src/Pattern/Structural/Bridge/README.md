# Bridge

__Bridge__ is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set of closely related 
classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently 
of each other.

__Identification__: Bridge can be recognized by a clear distinction between some controlling entity and 
several platforms that it relies on.
