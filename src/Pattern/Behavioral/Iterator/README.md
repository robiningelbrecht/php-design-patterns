# Command

__Command__ is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains 
all information about the request. This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments, 
delay or queue a requestâ€™s execution, and support undoable operations.

__Identification__: The pattern is recognizable by behavioral methods of one group of objects 
that indirectly call the same methods in other objects, while all the objects follow the common interface.
