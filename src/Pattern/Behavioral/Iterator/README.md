# Iterator

__Iterator__ is a behavioral design pattern that lets you traverse elements of a collection 
without exposing its underlying representation (list, stack, tree, etc.).

__Identification__: Iterator is easy to recognize by the navigation methods (such as next, previous and others). 
Client code that uses iterators might not have direct access to the collection being traversed.
