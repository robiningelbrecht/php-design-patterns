# Strategy

__Strategy__ is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, 
put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.

__Identification__: Strategy pattern can be recognized by a method that lets nested object do the actual work, 
as well as the setter that allows replacing that object with a different one.
