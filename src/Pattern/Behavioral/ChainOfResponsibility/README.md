# Chain Of Responsibility

__Chain Of Responsibility__ is a behavioral design pattern that lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers.
Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler 
in the chain.

__Identification__: The pattern is recognizable by behavioral methods of one group of objects 
that indirectly call the same methods in other objects, while all the objects follow the common interface.
