# Observer

__Observer__ is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects 
about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.

__Identification__: The pattern can be recognized by subscription methods, that store objects in a list and by calls to 
the update method issued to objects in that list.
