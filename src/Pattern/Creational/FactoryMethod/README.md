# Factory Method

![Factory method](/public/assets/Pattern/Creational/FactoryMethod/icon.png)

__Factory Method__ is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, 
but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

__Identification__: Factory methods can be recognized by creation methods, which create objects from concrete classes, 
but return them as objects of abstract type or interface.
